      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As a passionate web developer with 1 year of experience in crafting
        responsive and user-friendly websites, I thrive on turning ideas into
        digital solutions. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combined
        with frameworks like React and Vue.js, allows me to build dynamic
        interfaces that enhance user experience. I am adept at collaborating
        with cross-functional teams to deliver projects on time and am
        continuously exploring the latest technologies and trends in web
        development. When I’m not coding, you can find me contributing to
        open-source projects or experimenting with new web design techniques to
        elevate my skill set further.

        <h3>A functional Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          This Basic Calculator project showcases my skills in front-end
          development by implementing a simple yet functional web-based
          calculator. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application
          allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition,
          subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user-friendly interface
          features a responsive design that works seamlessly across various
          devices, ensuring an optimal user experience. By utilizing JavaScript
          for the application logic, I demonstrated my ability to manage user
          input, perform calculations, and update the display dynamically. This
          project not only highlights my coding skills but also my commitment to
          creating intuitive and accessible web applications.

        <h3>Responsive Image Gallery</h3>
        <p>
          This Basic Image Gallery project showcases my front-end development
          skills through a visually appealing and interactive web application.
          Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the gallery features a grid
          layout of images that users can click to view in a larger format
          within a modal window. The project incorporates responsive design
          principles, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices and
          screen sizes. With JavaScript handling image navigation and modal
          functionality, I’ve demonstrated my ability to create dynamic user
          interfaces. This project exemplifies my attention to detail and
          understanding of user experience design, making it a valuable addition
          to my portfolio.
